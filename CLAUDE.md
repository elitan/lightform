# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

iop is a zero-downtime Docker deployment tool that lets you deploy any Docker app to your own servers with automatic HTTPS and no configuration complexity.

**üîß Package Manager**: This project uses `bun` and not `npm` or other package managers.

**üêõ Debugging**: For live debugging and testing workflows, check out [./DEBUG.md](./DEBUG.md) - it contains comprehensive debugging commands, testing workflows, and troubleshooting guides.

## Project Overview

**Core Value Proposition**: Own your infrastructure without the complexity. Deploy Docker apps to your servers with zero configuration.

**Key Features**:

- Zero-downtime blue-green deployments
- Registry-free deployment (build locally, transfer via SSH)
- Automatic fresh server setup with security hardening
- Auto-SSL with Let's Encrypt and instant domains
- Multi-server support with load balancing
- Git-based releases for easy rollbacks

**Philosophy**: No rollback commands needed - just checkout the git commit you want and run `iop deploy` again.

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

```

### CLI (TypeScript) - `./packages/cli/`

**Entry Point**: `src/index.ts` - Main CLI router handling command dispatch

**Core Commands** (`src/commands/`):

- **`init.ts`**: Creates `iop.yml` config and `.iop/secrets`
- **`deploy.ts`**: Zero-downtime deployment with blue-green strategy
- **`status.ts`**: Comprehensive status reporting across all servers
- **`proxy.ts`**: Proxy management (status, updates)
- **`blue-green.ts`**: Core zero-downtime deployment logic (used by deploy)

**Supporting Modules**:

- **`config/`**: Configuration parsing and validation with Zod schemas
- **`docker/`**: Docker image building, compression, and transfer
- **`ssh/`**: SSH connection management and command execution
- **`utils/`**: Logging, port checking, SSL domain generation, release management
- **`proxy/`**: Proxy status checking and communication
- **`setup-proxy/`**: Proxy installation and configuration

### Proxy (Go) - `./packages/proxy/`

**Entry Point**: `cmd/iop-proxy/main.go` - Proxy server with CLI capabilities

**Core Packages** (`internal/`):

- **`api/`**: HTTP API server for CLI communication (localhost:8080)
- **`cert/`**: Let's Encrypt certificate management and renewal
- **`proxy/`**: HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy with TLS termination
- **`router/`**: Request routing and host-based traffic switching
- **`state/`**: Persistent state management for deployments and certificates
- **`health/`**: Container health checking and monitoring
- **`deployment/`**: Blue-green deployment controller
- **`events/`**: Event bus for internal communication

**Key Concepts**:

- **State Persistence**: All proxy state stored in `/var/lib/iop-proxy/state.json`
- **Dual Mode**: Runs as proxy server OR CLI commands via HTTP API
- **Background Workers**: Certificate acquisition, renewal, state persistence
- **Zero-Downtime**: Network alias switching for seamless traffic routing

## Development Guidelines

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build everything
bun run build

# Build specific packages
bun run build:cli    # TypeScript CLI
bun run build:proxy # Go proxy binary

# Run CLI in development
cd packages/cli && bun run start

# Run tests
bun run test        # All tests
bun run test:cli    # CLI tests only
```

### Configuration Files

**`iop.yml`** (Main config):

```yaml
name: my-app
ssh:
  username: iop
services: # Unified services model - everything is a service
  web: # Services with 'proxy' config get zero-downtime deployment
    build: { context: . }
    server: server.com
    proxy: { app_port: 3000 }
    environment:
      secret: [DATABASE_URL]
  postgres: # Infrastructure services get stop-start deployment
    image: postgres:15
    server: db.com
    ports: ["5432:5432"]
    environment:
      secret: [POSTGRES_PASSWORD]
```

**`.iop/secrets`** (Environment variables):

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/myapp
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=supersecret
```

### Key Development Patterns

1. **Error Handling**: All CLI commands use consistent error reporting with suggestions
2. **SSH Operations**: All server communication goes through `ssh/` utilities
3. **State Management**: Proxy maintains authoritative state, CLI queries/updates via HTTP API
4. **Unified Services**: Services with `proxy` config get blue-green deployment, others get stop-start
5. **Security First**: Automatic server hardening, fail2ban, SSH security
6. **Multi-Server**: All operations work across multiple servers in parallel

### Testing Strategy

**Local Testing**:

- Use examples in `examples/` directory
- Test server: `157.180.47.213` (see DEBUG.md)
- Always enable staging mode for SSL testing

**Testing Workflow** (see DEBUG.md for full details):

1. Test deploy the basic example
2. Check logs on server
3. Understand the problem
4. Update code
5. Redeploy
6. Repeat until working

### Code Organization Philosophy

**CLI (`packages/cli/`)**:

- Each command is self-contained in `commands/`
- Shared utilities in `utils/` and supporting modules
- Heavy use of TypeScript for type safety
- Zod schemas for configuration validation

**Proxy (`packages/proxy/`)**:

- Clean separation of concerns with `internal/` packages
- Interfaces defined in `core/interfaces.go`
- Comprehensive test coverage in `test/` directory
- HTTP API for CLI communication

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New CLI Command

1. Create `packages/cli/src/commands/new-command.ts`
2. Import and add to router in `packages/cli/src/index.ts`
3. Follow existing patterns for SSH operations and error handling
4. Add tests in `packages/cli/tests/`

### Modifying Proxy Behavior

1. Update relevant package in `packages/proxy/internal/`
2. Test locally with examples
3. Publish updated proxy: `cd packages/proxy && ./publish.sh`
4. Proxy auto-updates during next deployment - no manual intervention needed

### Adding Configuration Options

1. Update Zod schemas in `packages/cli/src/config/types.ts`
2. Update example configs in `examples/`
3. Handle new options in relevant command files

## Important Files to Understand

**CLI Core Logic**:

- `packages/cli/src/commands/deploy.ts` - Main deployment orchestration
- `packages/cli/src/commands/blue-green.ts` - Zero-downtime deployment logic
- `packages/cli/src/commands/setup.ts` - Server bootstrapping and infrastructure setup
- `packages/cli/src/config/types.ts` - Configuration schemas and validation

**Proxy Core Logic**:

- `packages/proxy/cmd/iop-proxy/main.go` - Main entry point and workers
- `packages/proxy/internal/deployment/controller.go` - Deployment management
- `packages/proxy/internal/proxy/proxy.go` - HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy
- `packages/proxy/internal/cert/manager.go` - SSL certificate management

**Examples and Testing**:

- `examples/basic/` - Simple Go app for testing
- `examples/nextjs/` - Next.js app example
- `DEBUG.md` - Comprehensive debugging and testing guide

## Key Concepts for AI Development

1. **Registry-Free Deployment**: Images built locally, compressed, transferred via SSH
2. **Unified Services Model**: Everything is a service - services with `proxy` config get zero-downtime blue-green deployment, others get stop-start
3. **Proxy as Source of Truth**: All deployment state lives in the proxy's state file (`/var/lib/iop-proxy/state.json`)
4. **Server Bootstrap**: Fresh servers get automatic Docker install and security hardening
5. **Auto-SSL with Staging**: Always use Let's Encrypt staging for testing to avoid rate limits
6. **Network Aliases**: Zero-downtime achieved by switching Docker network aliases
7. **Multi-Server**: All operations designed to work across multiple servers in parallel
8. **HTTP API Communication**: Proxy exposes HTTP API on localhost:8080 for CLI communication

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

**Primary Resource**: See [DEBUG.md](./DEBUG.md) for comprehensive debugging workflows, commands, and troubleshooting patterns.

**Quick Debug Commands**:

```bash
# Check proxy status and logs
ssh iop@157.180.47.213 "docker logs --tail 50 iop-proxy"

# Check deployment status
ssh iop@157.180.47.213 "docker exec iop-proxy /usr/local/bin/iop-proxy list"

# Enable staging mode for SSL testing (critical)
ssh iop@157.180.47.213 "docker exec iop-proxy /usr/local/bin/iop-proxy set-staging --enabled true"

# Test connectivity
curl -k -I https://test.eliasson.me

# HTTP API debugging
ssh iop@157.180.47.213 "docker exec iop-proxy curl -s localhost:8080/api/hosts"
ssh iop@157.180.47.213 "docker exec iop-proxy curl -s localhost:8080/api/status"
```

**Local Development Setup**:

```bash
# Build the CLI and set up for local development
bun run build            # Build everything from repo root
cd packages/cli
bun link                 # Make iop command available globally
# Now you can use `iop` anywhere (e.g. in examples/)
```

## V1 Completion Status

The project is feature-complete for V1 with:

- ‚úÖ Zero-downtime deployments
- ‚úÖ Automatic server setup and security
- ‚úÖ Auto-SSL with Let's Encrypt
- ‚úÖ Multi-server support
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive status reporting
- ‚úÖ Registry-free deployment

**Not needed for V1** (intentional design decisions):

- ‚ùå Rollback commands (use git checkout + redeploy)
- ‚ùå Built-in monitoring (operators can integrate external tools)
- ‚ùå Database migrations (application responsibility)

This is a production-ready deployment tool focused on simplicity and reliability over feature bloat.

## Reserved Names and Constraints

- Service names cannot be: `init`, `status`, `proxy` (CLI command names)
- Services must have either `image` or `build` config, but not both
- Test server for development: `157.180.47.213` (SSH username: `iop`)

## Command-Line Interface

**Default Command**: `iop` (no arguments) runs deployment
**Available Commands**: `init`, `deploy`, `status`, `proxy`
**Global Flags**: `--help`, `--verbose`

## Proxy Publishing and Updates

When modifying proxy code:
1. `cd packages/proxy && ./publish.sh` - Publishes to Docker Hub as `elitan/iop-proxy:latest`
2. Proxy auto-updates during next CLI deployment - no manual steps needed
3. For manual proxy updates: infrastructure setup during deployment pulls latest automatically

## Memories

- When we want to release, the info is in @RELEASE.md
